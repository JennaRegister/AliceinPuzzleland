# AliceinPuzzleland

The goal of this project is to present machine learning problems in a whimsical and fun way. ***Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*** and it's partner ***Through the Looking Glass*** are actually filled with mathematics and logic puzzles (Lewis Carroll himself being a mathematician). Here we will take the math of Alice to the next level, by introducing a machine learning component. Imagine the nonsensical, recursive, probabilistic world that Alice could have lived in, given programming today. Well, here we go.
